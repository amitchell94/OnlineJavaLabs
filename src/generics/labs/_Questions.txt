Answer the following questions:

1.) Why do we use generics?

    Generics make a program more flexible, it allows you to be generic about types when defining a class,
    which users can then be specific of which type they want to use when they create the object.

2.) What is type erasure?

    Type erasure is where all generic type parameters are replaced at compile time by Java.

3.) What is an example of a generic class that we have seen in the past?

    ArrayList is a generic class we have used in the past, ArrayLists can accept several different
    be lists of several different datatypes.

4.) Can an interface be generic?

    Yes, an interface can be generic.

5.) What are bound and unbound generic types?

    Bounded generic types are type parameters that are restricted to certain range of data types.
    Unbounded generic types are type parameters where the data type is unrestricted.
