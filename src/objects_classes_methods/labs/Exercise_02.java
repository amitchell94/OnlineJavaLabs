/**
 * Objects, Classes and Methods Exercise 2:
 *
 *      Create a class that demonstrates the following: (all methods below can be in the same class)
 *
 *      1) A static method that calls another static method.
 *      2) A static method that calls a non-static method.
 *      3) A non-static method1 that calls another non-static method2, but this time method2 should return a value to method1.
 *      4) A non-static method1 that calls another non-static method2 and passes a value to method2.
