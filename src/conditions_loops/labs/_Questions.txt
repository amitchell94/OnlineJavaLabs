Answer the following questions:

1.) What is the if statement used for?

    The if statement is used to determine if a condition id true or false, if the condition is true,
    then the code inside its code block will be executed.

2.) What is good real life application of a switch statement?



3.) What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?

    A while loop will only execute while the condition is true, whereas a do-while loop
    will execute once regardless and loop again if the condition is true.

4.) What is the difference between a for loop and an enhanced for loop?

    The enhanced for loop is also known as the foreach loop. It is used to iterate over a collection of variables
    such as arrays.

5.) How do you create an infinite for loop?

    for (;;) {

            }

6.) What is the difference between the break statement and the continue statement?

    The break statement will break you out of the loop entirely, whereas the continue statement
    will only end the current iteration and continue the loop on the next iteration.

7.) Is there a limit to how many loops you can nest?

    There no real limit other than the limit of the size of the method

8.) Is there a limit to how many conditional statements you can nest?

    Again, no real limit other than the method size limit
