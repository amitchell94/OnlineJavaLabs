2.) Why do we use git and Github?
    - We use git in order to keep track of changes to a directory locally.
      By committing changes to the git repository, we can log who made what change and when.
      Github allows us to do this on a server so that several different people can access the repository
      and make changes remotely.

3.) What is the general flow of git?
    - After making your changes you would add your files using the "git add <filename>" command.
      You  would then commit these changes using "git commit -m <comment>"
      You would then push these changes using "git push"

4.) What is the purpose of adding a remote to a local git repository?
    - This allows you to push changes from your local git repository to a remote repository elsewhere.

5.) How do you print a message to the console?
    System.out.print("a message");

6.) Where does a program begin its execution?
    - Inside public static void main(String[] args) { }

7.) What is a code block and how do you create one?
    -  A code block is anything that is contained within: {}

8.) What is the idea of variable scope?
    - Variables declared within a code block cannot be used outside of this code block.

9.) What are semicolons used for?
    - Semicolons are used to signify the end of a statement

10.) What are lines of code indented? When should a line be indented?
    - lines of code are indented in order to improve readability. Lines should be indented when inside a code block.
