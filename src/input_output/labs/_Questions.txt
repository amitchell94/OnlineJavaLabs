Answer the following questions:

1.) What is a byte stream?

    Byte streams are what programs use to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes.

2.) What is a character stream?

    Character stream I/O translates Javas internal character storing format to and from the local character set.

3.) What two classes are at the top of the the byte stream hierarchy?

    InputStream and OutputStream.

4.) What two classes are at the top of the the character stream hierarchy?

    Reader and Writer.

5.) List at least three byte stream classes.

    PipedInputStream, ObjectInputStream, FileInputStream.

6.) List at least three character stream classes.

    InputStreamReader, PipedReader, BufferedReader

7.) What is a try-with-resources?

    A try-with-resources statement is a try statement that also declares resources. It ensures that these resources
    are closed at the end of the statement.

8.) What makes the BufferedReader different from the BufferedInputStream?

    The BufferedReader reads text from a character input stream and the BufferedInputStream
    reads bytes from a byte stream

9.) When would you use the read() method vs. the readline() method?

    You would use the readline() method when using a BufferedReader as it will store all data in the linefeed.
    The read() method would only give you one character, so you would use this when you wanted to write a program
    that deals with individual characters.
