Answer the following questions:

1.) What is inheritance?

    When a class is created, it is possible to add a superclass using the extend keyword,
    the class then inherits the members of that superclass.

2.) Why do we use inheritance?

    Inheritance allows code to be used in several places. It means that you only need to write
    the unique features of a class while the rest of the common properties can be inherited from a
    superclass.

3.) Provide a real world example where you think inheritance would be implemented.

    If you were to create a class Animal which contained the variables and methods that all animal objects require.
    If you were then to make a subclass Cat which had the same variables and methods as an animal, by using
    inheritance all these members can be included in the Cat class when it is declared.

4.) How does a class inherit another class?

    A class inherits another class using the 'extends' keyword.

5.) How many levels can a hierarchy extend?

    Up to the maximum value of an Integer.

6.) What is the "super" keyword used for?

    The super keyword is a reference variable to refer to the parent class object.

7.) When a subclass object is created, in what order do the constructors execute?

    The constuctor of the super class is executed first.

8.) What is method overwriting?

    If a subclass has the same method as the parent class, this is method overwriting.

9.) How can method overwriting be beneficial?

    Method overwriting can be beneficial as it allows a subclass to provide a
    specific implementation of a method provided from a superclass.
