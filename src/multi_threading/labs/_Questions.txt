Answer the following questions:

1.) What is a thread and why do we use them?

    When code is excecuted in Java it is done on a thread.
    By using threads, we can run multiple code blocks at the same time.

2.) What are the two ways to create a thread?

    You can implement the Runnable interface or extend the Thread class.

3.) How do you start a thread using the Runnable interface?

    class Class1 implements Runnable {
        Thread thread;

        Class1 (String name) {
            thread = new Thread(this, name);

            thread.start();
        }

        public void run() {
            //Code goes here
        }
    }

4.) How do you start a thread using the Thread class?

    class Class1 extends Thread {
        Class1(String name) {
            super(name);

            start();
        }

        public void run() {
            //Code goes here
        }
    }

5.) How do you change a thread priority?

    Using the setPriority method like so:

        thread1.setPriority(1);
